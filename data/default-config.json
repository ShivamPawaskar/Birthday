The way we sit there smiling at the chaos, but quietly understanding the morals behind it. It makes me think about us, about how love isn’t perfect but it’s patient, forgiving, and always choosing each other at the end of the day.",

From building our little home block by block, to fighting the dragon like it actually mattered… from dying in the Nether and laughing about it, to just standing there fishing on some random island — every moment meant more because it was with you. It wasn’t just a game. It was us creating something, messing up, trying again, and just existing in our own small world. I don’t think I could ever forget those moments. If I’m being honest, I wish I could relive them again and again — not because of the game, but because it was you beside me the whole time.",

    "letterText": "My Dear Catooo,\n\nIf I had one quiet minute with your heart, I would spend it saying thank you. Thank you for every soft moment, every patient smile, every ordinary day you turned into something unforgettable. I still find pieces of you in my routine — in songs, in empty roads, in the way evening light falls through the window. You made love feel safe for me. You made forever feel possible.\n\nI do not promise perfection. I promise presence. I promise I will keep learning you, choosing you, and protecting the peace we built together. Even when life gets loud, I will always return to this truth: loving you is the most natural thing I have ever done.\n\nYou don’t even realize how much you’ve changed me. The way I think. The way I care. The way I look at the future. Before you, love felt like something uncertain. With you, it feels steady. Gentle. Real. You are not just someone I love — you are someone I feel safe with, someone I admire, someone I want beside me in every version of my life.\n\nI love the way you laugh without holding back. I love the quiet way you feel things deeply. I love the chaos, the softness, the strength you don’t even see in yourself. Every little detail — the way you talk, the way you tease, the way you go quiet when you’re thinking — it all matters to me more than you know.\n\nIf life ever tests us, I want you to remember this: I am here. Not just for the easy days, but for the confusing ones, the heavy ones, the days when you doubt yourself. I will stand beside you. I will remind you who you are when you forget. I will choose you again and again, even on the days it requires patience, growth, and effort.\n\nAnd if you ever forget how deeply you are loved, read this again. And again. And again.\n\nBecause there is no version of my future where I don’t want you in it.\n\nAlways yours.",
